Meowcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Meowcoin Core is the original Meowcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Meowcoin transactions, which requires several hundred gigabytes or more of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days or more.

To download Meowcoin Core, visit [meowcoincore.org](https://www.mewccrypto.com/en/download/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Meowcoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/meowcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/meowcoind` (headless)
- `bin/meowcoin` (wrapper command)

The `meowcoin` command supports subcommands like `meowcoin gui`, `meowcoin node`, and `meowcoin rpc` exposing different functionality. Subcommands can be listed with `meowcoin help`.

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run meowcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Meowcoin Core to your applications folder, and then run Meowcoin Core.
